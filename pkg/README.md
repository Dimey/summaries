# FD Summary

This folder contains LaTeX classes and packages used in the summaries.

These packages are work in progress, so they shall not be installed directly into a texmf directory. Rather symlink to this folder from the texmf directory and rehash it.

    ln -s path/to/pkg path/to/texmf/tex/latex/fdsummarypkg
    texhash
